# Hash Grabber
### Simples Fork, made to assist even more server creators in FiveM who need to get several hashes of addon vehicles.

- [x] Client-Side optimization.
- [x] Run only once when entering the server.
- [x] Send a message with embed if desired, with in-line fields for easy reading.
- [x] Message sent via WebHook can be in the format needed to insert in Los Santos Customs.
- [x] Withdrawal Thread that was around the Server-Side function.
- [x] Removed several unnecessary variables in `Client.lua`.

Planned Changes:
