# Hash Grabber
### Simples Fork, made to assist even more server creators in FiveM who need to get several hashes of addon vehicles.

Removed webhook, hashes are now saved to a text file on the server. There is a chat command gethashes to re run the script.
You can enter as many spawn names as you need to genrate a hash list.
